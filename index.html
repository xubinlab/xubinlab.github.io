    <h2>NOTES</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Technical notes on CFD / simulation / HPC / chips / AI will be continuously updated here.
      Below is an example note showing the general style of subsequent articles: 
      following a "Problem—Analysis—Conclusion" structure, clearly stating premises and boundaries.
    </p>

    <article class="note">
      <h3>Example: Functional Positioning and Application Scenarios of Commercial FEA Software (Personal Notes)</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        This is a rough summary based on public information and personal understanding, 
        mainly to help clarify the general positioning of common structural FEA / impact software.
        Not an official evaluation, nor representing any vendor's position, 
        only for communication and self-check: when encountering certain types of problems, 
        which software I would think of, and their respective strengths and obvious weaknesses.
      </p>

      <h4>1. Abaqus: Nonlinear &amp; General Structural Analysis</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Nonlinear, general FEA.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Strengths:</strong> Good solver robustness and functional coverage in geometric/material/contact nonlinear problems, suitable for complex structural static/dynamic and multi-step load analysis; strong Python interface extensibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Impression:</strong> In many engineers' experience, when doing structural nonlinear analysis, Abaqus parameter configuration is relatively "worry-free," with better convergence experience than some general software.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations &amp; Cost:</strong> Large software system, relatively steep learning curve; while capable of extreme dynamic problems like impact/explosion, the industry usually has more specialized choices.</li>
        <li><strong>When to Consider:</strong> Complex nonlinear structural problems, system-level analysis requiring most processes within the same platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2. Ansys: Multi-Physics &amp; Platform Integration</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Multi-physics, multi-module.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Strengths:</strong> Through acquisitions and integration, formed multiple modules including structures, fluids, electromagnetics, suitable for multi-physics coupling and cross-disciplinary engineering problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong> APDL language is highly programmable, used by many engineers as an "engineering scripting environment"; mature applications in fluids, electromagnetics, transient dynamics, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Weaknesses:</strong> Some specialized fields (such as geotechnical, some highly nonlinear analysis) may not be the first choice; thermal analysis, geotechnical, etc. need to be judged based on specific versions and modules.</li>
        <li><strong>When to Consider:</strong> Projects naturally involve multi-physics coupling, or when the team already has a complete Ansys ecosystem (preprocessing, postprocessing, interfaces are all smooth).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3. LS-DYNA: Impact &amp; Collision</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Explicit dynamics, impact, collision, forming.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Strengths:</strong> One of the industry benchmarks for highly nonlinear dynamic problems such as high-speed collisions, explosions, metal forming, with very rich material models and element types.</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Long history, early use in defense-related problems, with extensive engineering validation; built-in fluid solver, capable of some fluid-structure coupling.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Complex model configuration under extreme problems, high user experience requirements; preprocessing/postprocessing without supporting tools (such as HyperMesh/HyperView) will reduce experience.</li>
        <li><strong>When to Consider:</strong> Automotive collision, structural impact, safety-related scenarios, or occasions requiring explicit dynamic solvers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4. MSC.Dytran: Highly Nonlinear Fluid-Structure Coupling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Fluid-structure coupling, highly nonlinear.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Positioning:</strong> Based on LS-DYNA framework, introducing PISCES fluid/fluid-structure capabilities, focusing on highly nonlinear fluid-structure coupling problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Relatively mature application experience for certain fluid-structure coupling conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Relatively limited material models, weak handling of geotechnical materials; lack of 2D/axisymmetric increases computational cost; compared to the latest LS-DYNA, somewhat conservative in contact algorithms, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5. ADINA: Nonlinear Solution Strategies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Special solution methods, nonlinear convergence.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Strengths:</strong> Features in solution strategies for complex nonlinear problems (contact, plasticity, failure), such as various nonlinear controls and automatic step size adjustment, aiming to improve convergence and stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering Significance:</strong> Provides solution choices different from mainstream software for difficult-to-converge structural nonlinear problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>6. Nastran: Linear Structures &amp; Aerospace Background</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Linear structural analysis, aerospace engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Strengths:</strong> Long history, widely used in aerospace and other fields, with extensive validation in linear FEA and dynamics analysis, good reputation for solution efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Bulk data format is flexible but not beginner-friendly; due to large user base, engineering experience and materials are very rich.</li>
        <li><strong>When to Consider:</strong> Linear/lightly nonlinear structural analysis, especially in industries with existing Nastran workflows (aerospace, mechanical, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7. Brief Impressions of Other Software</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ALGOR:</strong> Emphasizes ease of learning and use, user-friendly interface, suitable as a rapid analysis tool for medium-scale engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>COSMOS:</strong> Known for multi-physics and solution speed, suitable for rapid iteration and integration into CAD/PLM environments.</li>
        <li><strong>MARC:</strong> Very strong nonlinear capabilities, solution speed superior to peers in some conditions, but input files and operation interface have high user requirements, more suitable for experienced users.</li>
        <li><strong>Radioss:</strong> Many customers in explicit dynamics and automotive collision, good overall workflow experience when paired with Altair's own preprocessing/postprocessing.</li>
        <li><strong>OptiStruct:</strong> Very prominent in structural optimization, topology optimization, lattice structure design; usable as a general implicit solver, but market positioning is more "optimization expert."</li>
        <li><strong>HyperMesh:</strong> Known for preprocessing and mesh generation, fine control over mesh quality and underlying control, standard configuration for many automotive/structural teams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>8. Summary: How to Use These "Labels" Without Over-Simplification</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Different software have their own historical baggage and strengths; "A is better" often only holds under specific problem categories and user experience.</li>
        <li>When actually selecting, usually consider: problem type (linear/nonlinear/impact/fluid-structure), existing workflow (what the team is already using), and whether future expansion to multi-physics is needed.</li>
        <li>This is just a personal "label table" for learning, convenient for quick categorization in the mind: when encountering an engineering requirement, which candidate tools should be considered, and their possible pitfalls.</li>
      </ul>
