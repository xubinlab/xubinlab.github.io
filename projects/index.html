      <h3>Aircraft Engine Full-Flowpath CFD Solver (2023-2024)</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
        <span class="tag">CFD Solver</span>
        <span class="tag">HPC</span>
        <span class="tag">Custom Chips</span>
      </div>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Developing a comprehensive CFD simulation platform for multi-stage aircraft engine components (fans, compressors, combustors, turbines), requiring both high accuracy and computational efficiency for engineering design cycles.</p>

      <h4>My Role & Goals</h4>
      <p>Lead solver architect and developer, responsible for numerical scheme implementation, implicit solver optimization, and hardware-software co-design. Goal: Achieve engineering-acceptable accuracy within 2-4 hour time budgets on available computing resources.</p>

      <h4>Technical Highlights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Equation non-dimensionalization and RANS turbulence modeling for complex internal flows</li>
        <li>Jacobian matrix construction and sparse linear system solving using Krylov methods</li>
        <li>MPI parallelization with domain decomposition for multi-core scaling</li>
        <li>Hardware-software co-design for custom chip deployment and memory optimization</li>
        <li>Performance profiling and bottleneck analysis across different computing platforms</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Results & Metrics</h4>
      <p>Achieved 3-5x acceleration on custom chips compared to traditional CPUs for representative test cases, while maintaining engineering accuracy within ±5% of commercial software results. Successfully deployed solver for production use in engine design workflows.</p>

      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>The project highlighted the importance of algorithm-hardware co-design in modern CFD development. Key learning: performance optimization requires understanding both numerical methods and hardware architecture at multiple levels.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>HPC Sparse Matrix Solver Optimization (2022-2023)</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
        <span class="tag">HPC</span>
        <span class="tag">Sparse Solvers</span>
        <span class="tag">Performance</span>
      </div>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>Implicit CFD solvers generate large sparse linear systems that dominate computation time. Traditional solvers struggle with irregular sparsity patterns and poor cache locality in engine flow simulations.</p>

      <h4>My Role & Goals</h4>
      <p>Solver algorithm researcher and optimizer, focusing on preconditioning strategies and parallel scaling. Goal: Improve convergence rate and parallel efficiency for industrial-scale engine simulations.</p>

      <h4>Technical Highlights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Analysis of sparsity patterns in CFD Jacobian matrices and their impact on solver performance</li>
        <li>Implementation and comparison of algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners</li>
        <li>Development of problem-specific preconditioning strategies for turbomachinery flows</li>
        <li>Memory bandwidth optimization and cache-aware data structures</li>
        <li>Load balancing algorithms for heterogeneous computing environments</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Results & Metrics</h4>
      <p>Reduced solver iteration count by 40-60% for compressor and turbine test cases through improved preconditioning. Achieved 85%+ parallel scaling efficiency on up to 1024 cores. Memory usage optimized by 30% through better data structures.</p>

      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>This work demonstrated that understanding the physics of the problem (flow characteristics, boundary conditions) is crucial for developing effective numerical algorithms. Domain knowledge + numerical methods = better solvers.</p>

      <h3>AI-Assisted CFD Development Pipeline (2024)</h3>
      <div class="project-meta">
        <span class="tag">AI</span>
        <span class="tag">Automation</span>
        <span class="tag">Software Engineering</span>
      </div>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>CFD development involves extensive parameter tuning, code refactoring, and performance analysis. Manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone, especially when deploying across different hardware platforms.</p>

      <h4>My Role & Goals</h4>
      <p>AI integration lead, exploring practical applications of AI tools in CFD workflows. Goal: Accelerate development cycles while maintaining code quality and numerical accuracy.</p>

      <h4>Technical Highlights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-assisted code generation and refactoring for numerical algorithms</li>
        <li>Automated parameter optimization using machine learning surrogate models</li>
        <li>Performance data analysis and bottleneck identification with AI tools</li>
        <li>Code review and testing automation for CFD-specific patterns</li>

      <h4>Results & Metrics</h4>
      <p>Reduced code development time by 35% for new numerical features. Improved parameter tuning efficiency by 50% through AI-assisted optimization. Enhanced code quality with automated review tools catching 25% more potential issues.</p>

      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>AI tools are most effective when used to augment engineering expertise rather than replace it. The key is knowing when and how to apply AI while maintaining physical understanding and numerical rigor.</p>
